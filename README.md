C-Sort-function

My first C++ sorting program I wrote

You can run the program and insert intergers into an array. This array will first be shown, then sorted and then the sorted array will be shown.

More information about the program can be found in the comment lines in the program itself.

A picture of the working program can be found in this repository under the name "working program.jpg"
